# window adventures
 
*a game by Lorenzo Vergani*

Description:
window adventures is a level-based platformer, where the player can jump around the screen. The player can resize and move the game window across the screen to discover new parts of the level and even the end!

But be careful, you can't have a too big window or your player will betoo fatigued and it will slow down and make it more vulnerable! 
Also, if the player gets killed or gets pushed out of the window, you will lose a life! Can you make your way in to the top of the tower?

game based on a modification of dafluffypotato framework, I added more functionalities to the engine.
